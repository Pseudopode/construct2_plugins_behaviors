Pode's Plugins
============

**This repository contains all the plugins and behaviors created by Pode on Scirra's Construct2 forum.**

For the third-party code used by some of the plugins, you need to refer to their original license.



###Additional info

Two plugins are created by rex_rainbow and R0j0hound:

* rex_video,  
* canvas,

are created by rex_rainbow and R0j0hound on Scirra's Construct2 forum. I placed them here only because I added some functions to the original plugins, and I maintain those portions of code.

###Third Party Libraries

Other plugins, including the:

* 1StrokeGestureRecognizer
* QRCode
* base32k
* chromanin
* pdfcreator 
* microphone

but not limited to, can include other licenses. These plugins can have their own licenses; we recommend you read them.
